    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm currently looking for a software engineer job in backend, infrasturcture,
      and machine learning systems (ML infrasturcture).
      I just received (09/2019) my PhD degree from New York University, advisied by Jinyang Li.
      My research focus on scalable machine learning systems that help AI developers to 
      scale the algorithmes.
      Before my PhD study, I worked 4 years in MediaTek, Taiwan, as a software engineer.
      My duty was to develop system softwares (e.g., hardware drivers and management sofrwares)
      for multi-core mobile phone processors.

education:
    - degree: PhD in Computer Science

          I mainly participated three projects during my PhD study.
          1. **SwapAdvisor: Support Large Deep Learning Models via Smart Swapping**
            SwapAdvisor, a swapping system that automatically swaps temporarily
            unused tensors from GPU memory to CPU memory. 
            To minimize the communication overhead, SwapAdvisor analyzes the
            dataflow graph of the given DNN model and uses a custom-designed
            genetic algorithm to optimize the operator scheduling and memory
            allocation.
            Based on the optimized operator schedule and memory allocation,
            SwapAdvisor can determine what and when to swap to achieve good
            performance.
          2. **Tofu: Distributing Tensor Computation for Large-scale Deep Learning**
          3. **Spartan: Distributed Array Programming Framework with Smart Tiling**

              Spartan is a distributed array framework, built on top of a set of
              higher-order dataflow operators.
              Based on the operators, Spartan provides a collection of
              Numpy-like array APIs. 
              To achieve good performance for the distributed application,
              Spartan analyzes the communication pattern of the dataflow graph
              captured through the operators and applies a greedy strategy to
              find a good partition scheme to minimize the communication cost.
